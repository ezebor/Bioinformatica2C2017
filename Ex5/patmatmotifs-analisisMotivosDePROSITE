# * EGF-like domain signatures and profile *
# ******************************************
# 
# A sequence of  about thirty  to forty amino-acid  residues  long found in  the
# sequence of  epidermal  growth  factor  (EGF)  has been  shown  [1 to 6] to be
# present, in  a more or less conserved form, in a large number of other, mostly
# animal  proteins.  EGF  is  a  polypeptide  of about 50 amino acids with three
# internal  disulfide  bridges.  It  first  binds with high affinity to specific
# cell-surface receptors and then induces their dimerization, which is essential
# for  activating  the  tyrosine  kinase  in  the  receptor  cytoplasmic domain,
# initiating  a  signal  transduction  that  results  in  DNA synthesis and cell
# proliferation.
# 
# A  common  feature  of  all  EGF-like  domains  is  that they are found in the
# extracellular  domain  of  membrane-bound  proteins or in proteins known to be
# secreted (exception: prostaglandin G/H synthase). The EGF-like domain includes
# six cysteine residues which have been shown to be involved in disulfide bonds.
# The  structure  of several EGF-like domains has been solved. The fold consists
# of   two-stranded  beta-sheet  followed  by  a  loop  to  a  C-terminal  short
# two-stranded sheet (see <PDB:1EGF). Subdomains between the conserved cysteines
# strongly  vary in length as shown in the following schematic representation of
# the EGF-like domain:

# 
# Two different  types  of thiolase [1,2,3] are found  both in eukaryotes and in
# prokaryotes: acetoacetyl-CoA thiolase (EC 2.3.1.9) and 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase
# (EC 2.3.1.16).  3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase (also called thiolase I)  has  a broad
# chain-length specificity  for  its substrates and is involved   in degradative
# pathways  such as  fatty acid  beta-oxidation.  Acetoacetyl-CoA thiolase (also
# called thiolase  II)  is  specific  for  the  thiolysis of acetoacetyl-CoA and
# involved in biosynthetic pathways such  as poly beta-hydroxybutyrate synthesis
# or steroid biogenesis.
# 
# In eukaryotes, there are two forms of 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase: one  located in
# the mitochondrion and the other in peroxisomes.
# 
# There are two conserved cysteine residues important for thiolase activity. The
# first located  in  the  N-terminal  section  of the enzymes is involved in the
# formation of an acyl-enzyme intermediate; the second located at the C-terminal
# extremity is   the   active   site  base  involved  in  deprotonation  in  the
# condensation reaction.
# 
# Mammalian nonspecific  lipid-transfer  protein (nsL-TP)  (also known as sterol
# carrier protein 2) is a protein which seems  to exist  in two different forms:
# a 14  Kd  protein  (SCP-2)  and  a larger 58 Kd protein (SCP-x). The former is
# found in the cytoplasm or the mitochondria and is involved in lipid transport;
# the latter is found in peroxisomes.  The C-terminal part of SCP-x is identical
# to SCP-2  while  the  N-terminal  portion is evolutionary related to thiolases
# [4].
# 
# We developed  three  signature  patterns  for  this family of proteins, two of
# which are  based  on  the regions around the biologically important cysteines.
# The third  is  based  on  a  highly conserved region in the C-terminal part of
# these proteins.

# * 2Fe-2S ferredoxin-type iron-sulfur binding domain signature and profile *
# ***************************************************************************
# 
# Ferredoxins  are small, acidic, electron transfer proteins that are ubiquitous
# in  biological  redox  systems.  They  have  either  4Fe-4S, 3Fe-4S, or 2Fe-2S
# cluster.  Among  them,  ferredoxin  with  one  2Fe-2S cluster per molecule are
# present  in  plants, animals, and bacteria, and form a distinct 2Fe-Ferredoxin
# family  [1,2].  They  are proteins of around one hundred amino acids with four
# conserved  cysteine  residues  to  which  the  2Fe-2S cluster is ligated. This
# conserved region is also found as a domain in various metabolic enzymes.
# 
# Several  structures  of the 2Fe-2S ferredoxin domain have been determined (see
# for example <PDB:4FXC>) [3]. The domain is classified as a beta-grasp which is
# characterized  as  having  a beta-sheet comprised of four beta-strands and one
# alpha-helix  flanking  the  sheet  [4].  The  two  Fe  atoms  are  coordinated
# tetrahedrally by the two inorganic S atoms and four cysteinyl S atoms.
# 
# Some proteins that contains a 2Fe-2S ferredoxin-type domain are listed below:
# 
#  - Ferredoxin from photosynthetic organisms;  namely plants and algae where it
#    is located in the chloroplast or cyanelle; and cyanobacteria.
#  - Ferredoxin from archaebacteria of the Halobacterium genus.
#  - Ferredoxin IV (gene pftA) and V (gene fdxD) from Rhodobacter capsulatus.
#  - Ferredoxin in the  toluene  degradation  operon (gene xylT) and naphthalene
#    degradation operon (gene nahT) of Pseudomonas putida.
#  - Hypothetical Escherichia coli protein yfaE.
# 
#  - The N-terminal domain  of the  bifunctional ferredoxin/ferredoxin reductase
#    electron  transfer  component of the benzoate 1,2-dioxygenase complex (gene
#    benC) from Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, the toluene 4-monooxygenase complex
#    (gene tmoF), the toluate 1,2-dioxygenase system (gene xylZ), and the xylene
#    monooxygenase system (gene xylA) from Pseudomonas.
#  - The N-terminal domain of  phenol  hydroxylase  protein  p5 (gene dmpP) from
#    Pseudomonas Putida.
#  - The N-terminal domain of  methane  monooxygenase   component C  (gene mmoC)
#    from Methylococcus capsulatus .
#  - The C-terminal domain of the vanillate degradation pathway  protein vanB in
#    a Pseudomonas species.
#  - The N-terminal domain of bacterial  fumarate  reductase iron-sulfur protein
#    (gene frdB).
#  - The  N-terminal  domain  of CDP-6-deoxy-3,4-glucoseen reductase (gene ascD)
#    from Yersinia pseudotuberculosis.
#  - The central domain of eukaryotic succinate dehydrogenase (ubiquinone) iron-
#    sulfur protein.
#  - The N-terminal domain of eukaryotic xanthine dehydrogenase.
#  - The N-terminal domain of eukaryotic aldehyde oxidase.
# 
# Three  of  the  four  conserved  cysteines  are clustered together in the same
# region  of  the  protein. Our signature pattern spans that iron-sulfur binding
# region. We also developed a profile that covers the whole domain.

# * Tubulin subunits alpha, beta, and gamma signature *
# *****************************************************
# 
# Tubulins [1,2], the major  constituent of  microtubules  are dimeric  proteins
# which consist of two closely related subunits (alpha and  beta). Tubulin binds
# two molecules of GTP at two different sites (N and E). At the E (Exchangeable)
# site, GTP is  hydrolyzed during incorporation into the microtubule. Near the E
# site is an invariant region rich in glycines which is found in both chains and
# which is now [3]  said to control the access of the nucleotide  to its binding
# site. We developed a signature pattern from this region.
# 
# With the exception of the simple eukaryotes, most species express a variety of
# closely related alpha and beta isotypes.
# 
# In most species there is a third member  of the tubulin family: gamma tubulin.
# Gamma tubulin is  found at  microtubule  organizing centers (MTOC) such as the
# spindle poles or the centrosome, suggesting that it  is involved in the minus-
# end nucleation of microtubule assembly [4].
# 
# -Consensus pattern: [SAG]-G-G-T-G-[SA]-G
# -Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL,  except
#  for maize tubulin beta-2 which has Leu in the first position of the pattern.
# -Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: 13.
# 
# -Note: The first residue in the pattern is Gly in all alpha and beta tubulins,
#  and is Ala or Ser in gamma-tubulin.
# -Note: This  pattern  is  almost  identical  to  the  GTP-binding  site of the
#  bacterial protein  ftsZ  (see  <PDOC00873>)  whose  role  in  prokaryotes  is
#  probably similar to that of tubulins.
